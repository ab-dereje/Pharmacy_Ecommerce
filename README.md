# Pharmacy_Ecommerce
The index page of our pharmacy e-commerce website serves as the main landing page for users, where they can browse the available medicines and products offered by our suppliers. This page is accessible to everyone, but users are required to create an account and sign in to access the full features of the website.

On the index page, users can see a list of medicines and products, along with their prices and short descriptions. Each product is displayed with an "Add" button that allows users to add the item to their cart. Clicking on the "Add" button will prompt the user to sign in or create an account if they haven't already done so.
